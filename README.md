# [Choose A Foundation](https://shanecurcuru.github.io/chooseafoundation/)

Inspired by GitHub's [Choose A License](https://choosealicense.com/), I wanted to help FOSS communities take it to the next level of organization.  Thus, [Choose A Foundation](https://shanecurcuru.github.io/chooseafoundation/) - when your project starts growing, you need to define your governance and decide how to manage project (and contributor!) growth.  Choose A Foundation is here to provide non-judgemental suggestions of the most popular FOSS Foundations that accept new projects as member projects.

## Design / Layout :art:

- Foundations are non-judgemental overviews.
- Pages are used to explain basic concepts.
- Posts are longer form descriptions and advice.
